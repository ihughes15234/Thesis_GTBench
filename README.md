# GT-Bench Expansion Thesis
This work was done for a Master's Thesis in Scientific Computing at TU Berlin. The foundation for the GTBench codebase comes from "GTBench: Uncovering the Strategic Reasoning Limitations of LLMs via Game-Theoretic Evaluations" by Authors: Jinhao Duan*, Renming Zhang*, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Lichao Sun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Tianlong Chen, and Kaidi Xu (*equal contribution). Modifications to the oringal codebase to support the fine-tuning, merging, and additional evaluation of SLMs are outlined in the figure below:

The 'Notebooks' folder and modifications to the original codebase were necessary to support this work while a full outline of the work can be found in the Thesis PDF. The original paper github repo is located at: https://github.com/jinhaoduan/GTBench.
